In this article, we present a new approach for upward crossing minimization, that is, finding an upward drawing of a DAG G with as few crossings as possible. Our algorithm is based on a two-stage upward planarization approach, which computes a feasible upward planar subgraph in the first step and reinserts the remaining arcs by computing constraint-feasible upward insertion paths. An experimental study shows that the new algorithm leads to much better results than existing algorithms for upward crossing minimization, including the classical Sugiyama approach.},\njournal = {ACM J.

The efficient solution of this problem is important in layered graph drawing. Our main observation is that it can be reduced to counting the inversions of a certain sequence. This leads to an O(\u2223E\u2223+\u2223C\u2223) algorithm, where C denotes the set of pairwise interior edge crossings, as well as to a simple O(\u2223E\u2223 log \u2223Vsmall\u2223) algorithm, where Vsmall is the smaller cardinality node set in the bipartition of the node set V of the graph. We present the algorithms and the results of computational experiments with these and other algorithms on a large collection of instances.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-540-36151-0\"\n}",

While it is often sufficient to explore only the summary statistics of a dataset (e.g., min/mean/max), Anscombe's Quartet demonstrates how such statistics can be misleading. We consider a similar problem in the context of graph mining. To study the relationships between different graph properties and statistics, we examine all low-order ({\\$}{\\$}{\\backslash}le {\\$}{\\$}10) non-isomorphic graphs and provide a simple visual analytics system to explore correlations across multiple graph properties. However, for graphs with more than ten nodes, generating the entire space of graphs becomes quickly intractable. We use different random graph generation methods to further look into the distribution of graph statistics for higher order graphs and investigate the impact of various sampling methodologies. We also describe a method for generating many graphs that are identical over a number of graph properties and statistics yet are clearly different and identifiably distinct.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-04414-5\"\n}",

We propose a neural network-based discriminator model trained on a labeled dataset that decides which of two layouts has a higher aesthetic quality. The feature vectors used as inputs to the model are based on known graph drawing quality metrics, classical statistics, information-theoretical quantities, and two-point statistics inspired by methods of condensed matter physics. The large corpus of layout pairs used for training and testing is constructed using force-directed drawing algorithms and the layouts that naturally stem from the process of graph generation. It is further extended using data augmentation techniques. Our model demonstrates a mean prediction accuracy of 96.48{\\%}, outperforming discriminators based on stress and on the linear combination of popular quality metrics by a small but statistically significant margin.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-04414-5\"\n}",

Rotational, translational, and especially reflectional symmetries, are also important in drawings of graphs. Detecting and classifying symmetries can be very useful in algorithms that aim to create symmetric graph drawings and in this paper we present a machine learning approach for these tasks. Specifically, we show that deep neural networks can be used to detect reflectional symmetries with 92{\\%} accuracy. We also build a multi-class classifier to distinguish between reflectional horizontal, reflectional vertical, rotational, and translational symmetries. Finally, we make available a collection of images of graph drawings with specific symmetric features that can be used in machine learning systems for training, testing and validation purposes. Our datasets, best trained ML models, source code are available online.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-35802-0\"\n}",

In many application domains these models evolve over time. Only few approaches to visualize such dynamic compound digraphs exist and mostly use animation to show the dynamics. In this paper we present a new visualization tool called TimeArcTrees that visualizes weighted, dynamic compound digraphs by drawing a sequence of node-link diagrams in a single view. Compactness is achieved by aligning the nodes of a graph vertically. Edge crossings are reduced by drawing upward and downward edges separately as colored arcs. Horizontal alignment of the instances of the same node in different graphs facilitates comparison of the graphs in the sequence. Many interaction techniques allow to explore the given graphs. Smooth animation supports the user to better track the transitions between views and to preserve his or her mental map. We illustrate the usefulness of the tool by looking at the particular problem of how shortest paths evolve over time. To this end, we applied the system to an evolving graph representing the German Autobahn and its traffic jams.},\nyear = {2009}\n}",

Although t-SNE is one of the best techniques for visualizing high-dimensional data as 2D scatterplots, t-SNE has not been used in the context of classical graph layout. We propose a new graph layout method, tsNET, based on representing a graph with a distance matrix, which together with a modified t-SNE cost function results in desirable layouts. We evaluate our method by a formal comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both visually and via established quality metrics on a comprehensive benchmark, containing real-world and synthetic graphs. As evidenced by the quality metrics and visual inspection, tsNET produces excellent layouts.},\nyear = {2017}\n}",

Hypergraphs are a fairly common data structure but there is little consensus on how to visualize them. To optimize a hypergraph drawing for readability, we need a layout algorithm. Common graph layout algorithms only consider ordinary graphs and do not take hyperedges into account. We focus on layered hypergraphs, a particular class of hypergraphs that, like layered graphs, assigns every vertex to a layer, and the vertices in a layer are drawn aligned on a linear axis with the axes arranged in parallel. In this paper, we propose a general method to apply layered graph layout algorithms to layered hypergraphs. We introduce six different transformations for layered hypergraphs. The choice of transformation affects the subsequent graph layout algorithm in terms of computational performance and readability of the results. Thus, we perform a comparative evaluation of these transformations in terms of number of crossings, edge length, and impact on performance. We also provide two case studies showing how our transformations can be applied to real-life use cases.
