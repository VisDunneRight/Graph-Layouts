An important distinction between techniques is whether the elements have a spatial location that is to be used for the visualization; for example, the elements are cities on a map. Strictly adhering to such location may severely limit the visualization and force overlay, intersections and other forms of clutter. On the other hand, completely ignoring the spatial dimension omits information and may hide spatial patterns in the data. We study layouts for set systems (or hypergraphs) in which spatial locations are displaced onto concentric circles or a grid, to obtain schematic set visualizations. We investigate the tractability of the underlying algorithmic problems adopting different optimization criteria (e.g. crossings or bends) for the layout structure, also known as the support of the hypergraph. Furthermore, we describe a simulated-annealing approach to heuristically optimize a combination of such criteria. Using this method in computational experiments, we explore the trade-offs and dependencies between criteria for computing high-quality schematic set visualizations.},\nyear = {2022}\n}",

Existing solutions lack the support for the interactive exploration of multiple flow components at once. Flow components are given by different materials being transported, different flow directions, or by the need for comparing alternative scenarios. In this paper, we combine flows as individual ribbons in one composite flow map. The presented approach can handle an arbitrary number of sources and sinks. To avoid visual clutter, we simplify our flow maps based on a force-driven algorithm, accounting for restrictions with respect to application semantics. The goal is to preserve important characteristics of the geospatial context. This feature also enables us to highlight relevant spatial information on top of the flow map such as traffic conditions or accessibility. The flow map is computed on the basis of flows between zones. We describe a method for auto-deriving zones from geospatial data according to application requirements. We demonstrate the method in real-world applications, including transportation logistics, evacuation procedures, and water simulation. Our results are evaluated with experts from corresponding fields.},\nyear = {2016}\n}",

This article deals with rendering graphs to show proximity between vertices by making their configuration (screen) distances reflect their distances in the graph. An arrangement method is described that achieves good drawings at speeds suitable for user interaction on a desktop computer. The method is \u201cincremental\u201d in that it first arranges a small portion of the graph, then arranges successively larger fractions of the graph until a suitable arrangement for the entirety is achieved. The incremental approach not only offers speed improvements, but avoids many of the suboptimal solutions reached with other iterative approaches. Algorithms are described in pseudocode, and results are presented.},\njournal = {ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum.

Our algorithm is based on a two-stage upward planarization approach, which computes a feasible upward planar subgraph in the first step and reinserts the remaining arcs by computing constraint-feasible upward insertion paths. An experimental study shows that the new algorithm leads to much better results than existing algorithms for upward crossing minimization, including the classical Sugiyama approach.},\njournal = {ACM J.

In this work, we investigate the problem of automatically drawing such maps on an octilinear grid with an arbitrary (but optimal) number of edge bends. Our approach can naturally deal with obstacles that should be respected in the final drawing (points of interest, rivers, coastlines) and can prefer grid edges near the real-world course of a line. This allows our drawings to be combined with existing maps, for example as overlays in map services. We formulate an integer linear program which can be used to solve the problem exactly. We also provide a fast approximation algorithm which greedily calculates shortest paths between node candidates on the underlying octilinear grid graph. Previous work used local search techniques to update node positions until a local optimum was found, but without guaranteeing octilinearity. We can thus calculate nearly optimal metro maps in a fraction of a second even for complex networks, enabling the interactive use of our method in map editors.},\nyear = {2020}\n}",

In many scenarios, these attributes (e.g., birth date in a family network) provide ambient context information for the graph structure, whose consideration is important for different visual graph analysis tasks. Graph attributes are usually conveyed using different visual representations (e.g., color, size, shape) or by reordering the graph structure according to the attribute domain (e.g., timelines). While visual encodings allow graphs to be arranged in a readable layout, assessing contextual information such as the relative similarities of attributes across the graph is often cumbersome. In contrast, attribute-based graph reordering serves the comparison task of attributes, but typically strongly impairs the readability of the structural information given by the graph's topology. In this work, we augment force-directed node-link diagrams with a continuous ambient representation of the attribute context. This way, we provide a consistent overview of the graph's topological structure as well as its attributes, supporting a wide range of graph-related analysis tasks. We resort to an intuitive height field metaphor, illustrated by a topographic map rendering using contour lines and suitable color maps. Contour lines visually connect nodes of similar attribute values, and depict their relative arrangement within the global context. Moreover, our contextual representation supports visualizing attribute value ranges associated with graph nodes (e.g., lifespans in a family network) as trajectories routed through this height field. We discuss how user interaction with both the structural and the contextual information fosters exploratory graph analysis tasks. The effectiveness and versatility of our technique is confirmed in a user study and case studies from various application domains.},\nyear = {2020}\n}",

This paper also proposes a combination algorithm that uses RVS to derive an initial layout and then applies Barnes-Hut to refine the layout. An evaluation of RVS and the combination algorithm compares their speed and quality on 109 graphs against a Barnes-Hut layout algorithm. The RVS algorithm performs up to 6.1 times faster on the tested graphs while maintaining comparable layout quality. The combination algorithm also performs faster than Barnes-Hut, but produces layouts that are more symmetric than using RVS alone. Data and code: https://osf.io/nb7m8/},\nyear = {2019}\n}",

Visualization is key to gaining insight into these processes and the associated data. Process visualization requires a high-quality graph layout that intuitively represents the semantics of the process. Process analysis additionally requires interactive filtering to explore the process data and process graph. The ideal process visualization therefore provides a high-quality, intuitive layout and preserves the mental map of the user during the visual exploration. The current industry standard used for process visualization does not satisfy either of these requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel layout algorithm for processes based on the Sugiyama framework. Our approach consists of novel ranking and order constraint algorithms and a novel crossing minimization algorithm. These algorithms make use of the process data to compute stable, high-quality layouts. In addition, we use phased animation to further improve mental map preservation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our approach computes layouts of higher quality and preserves the mental map better than the industry standard. Additionally, our approach is substantially faster, especially for graphs with more than 250 edges.},\nyear = {2019}\n}",

However, constraint-based layout often requires many individual constraints defined over specific nodes and node pairs. In addition to the effort of writing and maintaining a large number of similar constraints, such constraints are specific to the particular graph and thus cannot generalize to other graphs in the same domain. To facilitate the specification of customized and generalizable constraint layouts, we contribute SetCoLa: a domain-specific language for specifying high-level constraints relative to properties of the backing data. Users identify node sets based on data or graph properties and apply high-level constraints within each set. Applying constraints to node sets rather than individual nodes reduces specification effort and facilitates reapplication of customized layouts across distinct graphs. We demonstrate the conciseness, generalizability, and expressiveness of SetCoLa on a series of real-world examples from ecological networks, biological systems, and social networks.},\nyear = {2018}\n}",

Typical visualizations thereof use either straight lines or plot the actual trajectories. To reduce clutter inherent to visualizing large OD datasets, bundling methods can be used. Yet, bundling OD trails in urban traffic data remains challenging. Two specific reasons hereof are the constraints implied by the underlying road network and the difficulty of finding good bundling settings. To cope with these issues, we propose a new approach called Route Aware Edge Bundling (RAEB). To handle road constraints, we first generate a hierarchical model of the road-and-trajectory data. Next, we derive optimal bundling parameters, including kernel size and number of iterations, for a user-selected level of detail of this model, thereby allowing users to explicitly trade off simplification vs accuracy. We demonstrate the added value of RAEB compared to state-of-the-art trail bundling methods on both synthetic and real-world traffic data for tasks that include the preservation of road network topology and the support of multiscale exploration.},\nyear = {2019}\n}",

It is often visualized as secondary information on top of primary information, such as the spatial positions of elements on maps and charts. Visualizing the temporal evolution of such set diagrams as well as their primary features is quite important; however, conventional approaches have only focused on the temporal behavior of the primary features and do not provide an effective means to highlight notable transitions within the set relationships. This paper presents an approach for generating a stepwise animation between set diagrams by decomposing the entire transition into atomic changes associated with individual data elements. The key idea behind our approach is to optimize the ordering of the atomic changes such that the synthesized animation minimizes unwanted set occlusions by considering their depth ordering and reduces the gaze shift between two consecutive stepwise changes. Experimental results and a user study demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively facilitates the visual identification of the detailed transitions inherent in dynamic set diagrams.},\nyear = {2019}\n}",

The efficient solution of this problem is important in layered graph drawing. Our main observation is that it can be reduced to counting the inversions of a certain sequence. This leads to an O(\u2223E\u2223+\u2223C\u2223) algorithm, where C denotes the set of pairwise interior edge crossings, as well as to a simple O(\u2223E\u2223 log \u2223Vsmall\u2223) algorithm, where Vsmall is the smaller cardinality node set in the bipartition of the node set V of the graph.

Hypergraphs are a fairly common data structure but there is little consensus on how to visualize them. To optimize a hypergraph drawing for readability, we need a layout algorithm. Common graph layout algorithms only consider ordinary graphs and do not take hyperedges into account. We focus on layered hypergraphs, a particular class of hypergraphs that, like layered graphs, assigns every vertex to a layer, and the vertices in a layer are drawn aligned on a linear axis with the axes arranged in parallel. In this paper, we propose a general method to apply layered graph layout algorithms to layered hypergraphs. We introduce six different transformations for layered hypergraphs. The choice of transformation affects the subsequent graph layout algorithm in terms of computational performance and readability of the results. Thus, we perform a comparative evaluation of these transformations in terms of number of crossings, edge length, and impact on performance. We also provide two case studies showing how our transformations can be applied to real-life use cases.

In many application domains these models evolve over time. Only few approaches to visualize such dynamic compound digraphs exist and mostly use animation to show the dynamics. In this paper we present a new visualization tool called TimeArcTrees that visualizes weighted, dynamic compound digraphs by drawing a sequence of node-link diagrams in a single view. Compactness is achieved by aligning the nodes of a graph vertically. Edge crossings are reduced by drawing upward and downward edges separately as colored arcs. Horizontal alignment of the instances of the same node in different graphs facilitates comparison of the graphs in the sequence. Many interaction techniques allow to explore the given graphs. Smooth animation supports the user to better track the transitions between views and to preserve his or her mental map. We illustrate the usefulness of the tool by looking at the particular problem of how shortest paths evolve over time. To this end, we applied the system to an evolving graph representing the German Autobahn and its traffic jams.},\nyear = {2009}\n}",

Although t-SNE is one of the best techniques for visualizing high-dimensional data as 2D scatterplots, t-SNE has not been used in the context of classical graph layout. We propose a new graph layout method, tsNET, based on representing a graph with a distance matrix, which together with a modified t-SNE cost function results in desirable layouts. We evaluate our method by a formal comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both visually and via established quality metrics on a comprehensive benchmark, containing real-world and synthetic graphs. As evidenced by the quality metrics and visual inspection, tsNET produces excellent layouts.},\nyear = {2017}\n}",

There are three main types of symmetry: reflective, translational, and rotational. We report the results of a human subjects experiment to determine what types of symmetries are more salient in drawings of graphs. We found statistically significant evidence that vertical reflective symmetry is the most dominant (when selecting among vertical reflective, horizontal reflective, and translational). We also found statistically significant evidence that rotational symmetry is affected by the number of radial axes (the more, the better), with a notable exception at four axes.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-04414-5\"\n}",

This very basic property has been studied extensively in the literature from a theoretic point of view and many bounds exist for a variety of graph classes. In this paper, we present the first algorithm able to compute the crossing number of general sparse graphs of moderate size and present computational results on a popular benchmark set of graphs. The approach uses a new integer linear programming formulation of the problem combined with strong heuristics and problem reduction techniques. This enables us to compute the crossing number for 91 percent of all graphs on up to 40 nodes in the benchmark set within a time limit of five minutes per graph.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-540-31667-1\"\n}",

While it is often sufficient to explore only the summary statistics of a dataset (e.g., min/mean/max), Anscombe's Quartet demonstrates how such statistics can be misleading. We consider a similar problem in the context of graph mining. To study the relationships between different graph properties and statistics, we examine all low-order ({\\$}{\\$}{\\backslash}le {\\$}{\\$}10) non-isomorphic graphs and provide a simple visual analytics system to explore correlations across multiple graph properties. However, for graphs with more than ten nodes, generating the entire space of graphs becomes quickly intractable. We use different random graph generation methods to further look into the distribution of graph statistics for higher order graphs and investigate the impact of various sampling methodologies. We also describe a method for generating many graphs that are identical over a number of graph properties and statistics yet are clearly different and identifiably distinct.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-04414-5\"\n}",

We propose a neural network-based discriminator model trained on a labeled dataset that decides which of two layouts has a higher aesthetic quality. The feature vectors used as inputs to the model are based on known graph drawing quality metrics, classical statistics, information-theoretical quantities, and two-point statistics inspired by methods of condensed matter physics. The large corpus of layout pairs used for training and testing is constructed using force-directed drawing algorithms and the layouts that naturally stem from the process of graph generation. It is further extended using data augmentation techniques. Our model demonstrates a mean prediction accuracy of 96.48{\\%}, outperforming discriminators based on stress and on the linear combination of popular quality metrics by a small but statistically significant margin.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-04414-5\"\n}",

Rotational, translational, and especially reflectional symmetries, are also important in drawings of graphs. Detecting and classifying symmetries can be very useful in algorithms that aim to create symmetric graph drawings and in this paper we present a machine learning approach for these tasks. Specifically, we show that deep neural networks can be used to detect reflectional symmetries with 92{\\%} accuracy. We also build a multi-class classifier to distinguish between reflectional horizontal, reflectional vertical, rotational, and translational symmetries. Finally, we make available a collection of images of graph drawings with specific symmetric features that can be used in machine learning systems for training, testing and validation purposes. Our datasets, best trained ML models, source code are available online.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-35802-0\"\n}",

Force-directed graph-drawing algorithms are widely used to draw such graphs. However, these methods do not guarantee a sub-quadratic running time in general. We present a new force-directed method that is based on a combination of an efficient multilevel scheme and a strategy for approximating the repulsive forces in the system by rapidly evaluating potential fields. Given a graph G=(V,E), the asymptotic worst-case running time of this method is O({\\ensuremath{|}}V{\\ensuremath{|}}log{\\ensuremath{|}}V{\\ensuremath{|}}+{\\ensuremath{|}}E{\\ensuremath{|}}) with linear memory requirements. In practice, the algorithm generates nice drawings of graphs with 100000 nodes in less than 5 minutes. Furthermore, it clearly visualizes even the structures of those graphs that turned out to be challenging for other methods.},\nurl = {https://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/54892/}\n}",

The multilevel process groups vertices to form clusters, uses the clusters to define a new graph and is repeated until the graph size falls below some threshold. The coarsest graph is then given an initial layout and the layout is successively refined on all the graphs starting with the coarsest and ending with the original. In this way the multilevel algorithm both accelerates and gives a more global quality to the force- directed placement. The algorithm can compute both 2 {\\&} 3 dimensional layouts and we demonstrate it on a number of examples ranging from 500 to 225,000 vertices. It is also very fast and can compute a 2D layout of a sparse graph in around 30 seconds for a 10,000 vertex graph to around 10 minutes for the largest graph.

These shapes support the display of information such as labels or encode various data with size or color. However, they can create overlaps between nodes which hinder the exploration process by hiding parts of the information. It is therefore of utmost importance to remove these overlaps to improve graph visualization readability. If not handled by the layout process, Overlap Removal (OR) algorithms have been proposed as layout post-processing. As graph layouts usually convey information about their topology, it is important that OR algorithms preserve them as much as possible. We propose a novel algorithm that models OR as a joint stress and scaling optimization problem, and leverages efficient stochastic gradient descent. This approach is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, and several quality metrics demonstrate its efficiency to quickly remove overlaps while retaining the initial layout structures.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-031-22203-0\"\n}",

We prove that the problem is NP-hard in the general case. For planar graphs we describe an ILP model that is fast in practice. We experimentally show that optimum solutions dramatically reduce the number of transitive edges with respect to unconstrained st-orientations computed via classical st-numbering algorithms.

Our algorithm is based on the sampling of vertices for computing repulsion forces and edge sparsification for attraction force computation. More specifically, for vertex sampling, we present three types of sampling algorithms, including random sampling, geometric sampling, and combinatorial sampling, to reduce the repulsion force computation to sublinear in the number of vertices. We utilize a spectral sparsification approach to reduce the number of attraction force computations to sublinear in the number of edges for dense graphs. We also present a smart initialization method based on radial tree drawing of the BFS spanning tree rooted at the center. Experiments show that our new sublinear time force computation algorithms run quite fast, while producing good visualization of large and complex networks, with significant improvements in quality metrics such as shape-based and edge crossing metrics.},\nyear = {2020}\n}",

These maps are often advertised on a web page or pamphlet highlighting routes from source to destination stations. To visually support such route-finding, designers often distort the layout by embedding symbolic shapes (e.g., circular routes) in order to guide readers' attention (e.g., Moscow map and Japan railway map). However, manually producing such maps is labor-intensive and the effect of shapes remains unclear. In this paper, we propose an approach to generalize such mixed metro maps that take user-defined shapes as an input. In this mixed design, lines that are used to approximate the shapes are arranged symbolically, while the remaining lines follow classical layout convention. A three-step algorithm, including (1) detecting and selecting routes for shape approximation, (2) shape and layout deformation, and (3) aligning lines on a grid, is integrated to guarantee good visual quality. Our contribution lies in the definition of the mixed metro map problem and the formulation of design criteria so that the problem can be resolved systematically using the optimization paradigm. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our approach and perform a user study to test if the embedded shapes are recognizable or reduce the map quality.},\nyear = {2022}\n}",

Many of the state-of-the-art techniques can show an overview of vertices and edges but lack a data-scalable visual representation of the time aspect. In this paper, we address the problem of displaying dynamic graphs with a thousand or more time steps. Our proposed interleaved parallel edge splatting technique uses a time-to-space mapping and shows the complete dynamic graph in a static visualization. It provides an overview of all data dimensions, allowing for visually detecting time-varying data patterns; hence, it serves as a starting point for further data exploration. By applying clustering and ordering techniques on the vertices, edge splatting on the links, and a dense time-to-space mapping, our approach becomes visually scalable in all three dynamic graph data dimensions. We illustrate the usefulness of our technique by applying it to call graphs and US domestic flight data with several hundred vertices, several thousand edges, and more than a thousand time steps.},\nyear = {2017}\n}",

However, tracking graphs are limited to a single level threshold and the graphs may vary substantially even under small changes to the threshold. To examine the evolution of features for varying levels, users have to compare multiple tracking graphs without a direct visual link between them. We propose a novel, interactive, nested graph visualization based on the fact that the tracked superlevel set components for different levels are related to each other through their nesting hierarchy. This approach allows us to set multiple tracking graphs in context to each other and enables users to effectively follow the evolution of components for different levels simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on datasets from finite pointset methods, computational fluid dynamics, and cosmology simulations.},\nyear = {2017}\n}",

While there is a substantial body of work in computer vision around the detection and measurement of symmetry in images, there has been little effort to define and validate meaningful measures of the symmetry of graph drawings. In this paper, we evaluate two algorithms that have been proposed for measuring graph drawing symmetry, comparing their judgments to those of human subjects, and investigating the use of stress as an alternative measure of symmetry. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of these measures, possible ways to improve them, and implications for the design of algorithms that optimize the symmetry in the layout.},\nyear = {2017}\n}",

A central role in finding the best therapy options for patients with solid tumors plays the Tumor, lymph Node, and Metastasis staging (TNM staging). Correctness of TNM staging has a significant impact on the therapy choice and hence on the patient's post-therapeutic quality of life or even survival. If inconsistencies in the TNM staging occur, possible explanations and solutions must be found based on the complex patient records, which takes the costly time of (multiple) physicians. We propose a more efficient visual analysis component, which supports a physician in verifying the given TNM staging before forwarding it to the tumor board. Our component comprises a Bayesian network model of the TNM staging process. Using information from the patient records and Bayesian inference, the models computes a patient-specific TNM staging, which is then explored and compared to the given staging by means of a graph-based visualization. Our component is implemented in a research prototype that supports an understanding of the model computations, allows for a fast identification of important influencing factors, and facilitates a quick detection of differences between two TNM stagings. We evaluated our component with five physicians, each studying 20 cases of laryngeal cancer.},\nyear = {2017}\n}",

Although the approach produces less ambiguous bundlings, it suffers from high computational cost. In this paper, we present a new Edge-Path bundling approach that increases the computational speed of the algorithm without reducing the quality of the bundling. First, we demonstrate that biconnected components can be processed separately in an Edge-Path bundling of a graph without changing the result. Then, we present a new edge bundling algorithm that is based on observing and exploiting a strong relationship between Edge-Path bundling and graph spanners. Although the worst case complexity of the approach is the same as of the original Edge-Path bundling algorithm, we conduct experiments to demonstrate that the new approach is 5\u2013256 times faster than Edge-Path bundling depending on the dataset, which brings its practical running time more in line with traditional edge bundling\u00a0algorithms.}\n}",
