This article deals with rendering graphs to show proximity between vertices by making their configuration (screen) distances reflect their distances in the graph. An arrangement method is described that achieves good drawings at speeds suitable for user interaction on a desktop computer. The method is \u201cincremental\u201d in that it first arranges a small portion of the graph, then arranges successively larger fractions of the graph until a suitable arrangement for the entirety is achieved. The incremental approach not only offers speed improvements, but avoids many of the suboptimal solutions reached with other iterative approaches. Algorithms are described in pseudocode, and results are presented.},\njournal = {ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum.

Our algorithm is based on a two-stage upward planarization approach, which computes a feasible upward planar subgraph in the first step and reinserts the remaining arcs by computing constraint-feasible upward insertion paths. An experimental study shows that the new algorithm leads to much better results than existing algorithms for upward crossing minimization, including the classical Sugiyama approach.},\njournal = {ACM J.

The efficient solution of this problem is important in layered graph drawing. Our main observation is that it can be reduced to counting the inversions of a certain sequence. This leads to an O(\u2223E\u2223+\u2223C\u2223) algorithm, where C denotes the set of pairwise interior edge crossings, as well as to a simple O(\u2223E\u2223 log \u2223Vsmall\u2223) algorithm, where Vsmall is the smaller cardinality node set in the bipartition of the node set V of the graph.

Although t-SNE is one of the best techniques for visualizing high-dimensional data as 2D scatterplots, t-SNE has not been used in the context of classical graph layout. We propose a new graph layout method, tsNET, based on representing a graph with a distance matrix, which together with a modified t-SNE cost function results in desirable layouts. We evaluate our method by a formal comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both visually and via established quality metrics on a comprehensive benchmark, containing real-world and synthetic graphs. As evidenced by the quality metrics and visual inspection, tsNET produces excellent layouts.},\nyear = {2017}\n}",

In many application domains these models evolve over time. Only few approaches to visualize such dynamic compound digraphs exist and mostly use animation to show the dynamics. In this paper we present a new visualization tool called TimeArcTrees that visualizes weighted, dynamic compound digraphs by drawing a sequence of node-link diagrams in a single view. Compactness is achieved by aligning the nodes of a graph vertically. Edge crossings are reduced by drawing upward and downward edges separately as colored arcs. Horizontal alignment of the instances of the same node in different graphs facilitates comparison of the graphs in the sequence. Many interaction techniques allow to explore the given graphs. Smooth animation supports the user to better track the transitions between views and to preserve his or her mental map. We illustrate the usefulness of the tool by looking at the particular problem of how shortest paths evolve over time. To this end, we applied the system to an evolving graph representing the German Autobahn and its traffic jams.},\nyear = {2009}\n}",

Hypergraphs are a fairly common data structure but there is little consensus on how to visualize them. To optimize a hypergraph drawing for readability, we need a layout algorithm. Common graph layout algorithms only consider ordinary graphs and do not take hyperedges into account. We focus on layered hypergraphs, a particular class of hypergraphs that, like layered graphs, assigns every vertex to a layer, and the vertices in a layer are drawn aligned on a linear axis with the axes arranged in parallel. In this paper, we propose a general method to apply layered graph layout algorithms to layered hypergraphs. We introduce six different transformations for layered hypergraphs. The choice of transformation affects the subsequent graph layout algorithm in terms of computational performance and readability of the results. Thus, we perform a comparative evaluation of these transformations in terms of number of crossings, edge length, and impact on performance. We also provide two case studies showing how our transformations can be applied to real-life use cases.

The coarsest graph is then given an initial layout and the layout is successively refined on all the graphs starting with the coarsest and ending with the original. In this way the multilevel algorithm both accelerates and gives a more global quality to the force- directed placement. The algorithm can compute both 2 {\\&} 3 dimensional layouts and we demonstrate it on a number of examples ranging from 500 to 225,000 vertices. It is also very fast and can compute a 2D layout of a sparse graph in around 30 seconds for a 10,000 vertex graph to around 10 minutes for the largest graph.

In addition, our approach allows for progressive computation, i.e. a rough approximation of the layout can be produced even faster, and then be refined until satisfaction.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Graph Drawing},\npages = {42\u201353},\nnumpages = {12},\nlocation = {Karlsruhe, Germany},\nseries = {GD'06}\n}",

While it is often sufficient to explore only the summary statistics of a dataset (e.g., min/mean/max), Anscombe's Quartet demonstrates how such statistics can be misleading. We consider a similar problem in the context of graph mining. To study the relationships between different graph properties and statistics, we examine all low-order ({\\$}{\\$}{\\backslash}le {\\$}{\\$}10) non-isomorphic graphs and provide a simple visual analytics system to explore correlations across multiple graph properties. However, for graphs with more than ten nodes, generating the entire space of graphs becomes quickly intractable. We use different random graph generation methods to further look into the distribution of graph statistics for higher order graphs and investigate the impact of various sampling methodologies. We also describe a method for generating many graphs that are identical over a number of graph properties and statistics yet are clearly different and identifiably distinct.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-04414-5\"\n}",

We propose a neural network-based discriminator model trained on a labeled dataset that decides which of two layouts has a higher aesthetic quality. The feature vectors used as inputs to the model are based on known graph drawing quality metrics, classical statistics, information-theoretical quantities, and two-point statistics inspired by methods of condensed matter physics. The large corpus of layout pairs used for training and testing is constructed using force-directed drawing algorithms and the layouts that naturally stem from the process of graph generation. It is further extended using data augmentation techniques. Our model demonstrates a mean prediction accuracy of 96.48{\\%}, outperforming discriminators based on stress and on the linear combination of popular quality metrics by a small but statistically significant margin.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-04414-5\"\n}",

Rotational, translational, and especially reflectional symmetries, are also important in drawings of graphs. Detecting and classifying symmetries can be very useful in algorithms that aim to create symmetric graph drawings and in this paper we present a machine learning approach for these tasks. Specifically, we show that deep neural networks can be used to detect reflectional symmetries with 92{\\%} accuracy. We also build a multi-class classifier to distinguish between reflectional horizontal, reflectional vertical, rotational, and translational symmetries. Finally, we make available a collection of images of graph drawings with specific symmetric features that can be used in machine learning systems for training, testing and validation purposes. Our datasets, best trained ML models, source code are available online.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-35802-0\"\n}",

This very basic property has been studied extensively in the literature from a theoretic point of view and many bounds exist for a variety of graph classes. In this paper, we present the first algorithm able to compute the crossing number of general sparse graphs of moderate size and present computational results on a popular benchmark set of graphs. The approach uses a new integer linear programming formulation of the problem combined with strong heuristics and problem reduction techniques. This enables us to compute the crossing number for 91 percent of all graphs on up to 40 nodes in the benchmark set within a time limit of five minutes per graph.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-540-31667-1\"\n}",

Force-directed graph-drawing algorithms are widely used to draw such graphs. However, these methods do not guarantee a sub-quadratic running time in general. We present a new force-directed method that is based on a combination of an efficient multilevel scheme and a strategy for approximating the repulsive forces in the system by rapidly evaluating potential fields. Given a graph G=(V,E), the asymptotic worst-case running time of this method is O({\\ensuremath{|}}V{\\ensuremath{|}}log{\\ensuremath{|}}V{\\ensuremath{|}}+{\\ensuremath{|}}E{\\ensuremath{|}}) with linear memory requirements. In practice, the algorithm generates nice drawings of graphs with 100000 nodes in less than 5 minutes. Furthermore, it clearly visualizes even the structures of those graphs that turned out to be challenging for other methods.},\nurl = {https://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/54892/}\n}",
